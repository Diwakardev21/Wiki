He appeared on Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list twice since 2017.[4][5]

He moved on to feature in Hindi television serials, his debut show was the romantic drama Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008), followed by the lead role in the soap opera Pavitra Rishta (2009–2011).

        Rajput died by suicide at his home in Bandra, Mumbai, in June 2020, aged 34.[6][7][8] Various controversies surrounded his death. The Narcotics Control Bureau claimed Rajput had been using various people to obtain drugs since 2018 and filed abetment charges against them. Abetment to suicide charges were filed against his former girlfriend, while the Supreme Court refused to quash a case against his sister Priyanka which alleged she had supplied him psychotropic anti-depressants without proper medical consultation, using a forged prescription.

    <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[20][21] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[22][23] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[24] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[25] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[26] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[27] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[28]</p></center>

        <p>The Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.[2] The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.</p> </center>S
